# 🗺️ OpsKnight Roadmap

This roadmap outlines our path to building the ultimate open-source incident management platform.

> **Current Status:** We are laser-focused on **Stability** and **Reliability**.

## 🏗 Phase 1: Foundation & Stability (Current Focus)

Our immediate goal is to stabilize the existing feature set and ensure rock-solid reliability for the V1 Release.

- [ ] **Core Reliability**: Exhaustive testing of the alerting pipeline and escalation engine.
- [ ] **Mobile PWA**: Polish the existing Progressive Web App (Offline support & Notifications).
- [ ] **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for APIs, deployment, and configuration.
- [ ] **User Experience**: Polishing the UI/UX for Schedules and Incident Command.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Expanding Communication

Once the core is stable, we will expand our alerting capabilities to make OpsKnight more "feature-rich".

- [ ] **Voice Call Alerts**: Native support for phone call escalations ([#9](https://github.com/dushyant-rahangdale/opsknight/issues/9)).
- [ ] **Conference Bridge**: Auto-create Jitsi/Zoom rooms for incidents ([#10](https://github.com/dushyant-rahangdale/opsknight/issues/10)).
- [ ] **Two-Way Slack**: Interactive Slack messages (Ack/Resolve directly from Slack).

## 🔌 Phase 3: Ecosystem & Intelligence

Long-term goals to make OpsKnight the smartest tool in your stack.

- [ ] **SLA Engine**:
  - [ ] Implement Business Hours logic (The Weekend Trap) ([#64](https://github.com/dushyant-rahangdale/opsknight/issues/64))
  - [ ] Manual SLA overrides per incident ([#65](https://github.com/dushyant-rahangdale/opsknight/issues/65))
- [ ] **Advanced Status Pages**: Support for multiple public/private status pages ([#12](https://github.com/dushyant-rahangdale/opsknight/issues/12)).
- [ ] **Custom Workflows**: Configurable incident state transitions ([#11](https://github.com/dushyant-rahangdale/opsknight/issues/11)).
- [ ] **Advanced Integrations**: Jira, ServiceNow, GitLab, Azure Monitor.
- [ ] **Incident Intelligence**: AI-driven alert correlation and automated post-mortems.
