## 🎯 Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Do First)
1. **Dark Mode** - User expectation
2. **Advanced Form Components** - Essential functionality
3. **Enhanced Data Visualization** - Core feature
4. **Search & Filtering** - Critical for usability

### Medium Priority
5. **Performance Optimizations** - Important for scale
6. **Documentation** - Developer experience
7. **Advanced Animations** - Polish

### Lower Priority
8. **Visual Polish** - Nice to have
9. **Testing** - Important but can be incremental

---

## 📊 Estimated Effort

- **Dark Mode:** 2-3 days
- **Advanced Form Components:** 3-4 days
- **Enhanced Data Visualization:** 4-5 days
- **Search & Filtering:** 2-3 days
- **Performance Optimizations:** 3-4 days
- **Documentation:** 2-3 days
- **Advanced Animations:** 1-2 days
- **Visual Polish:** 1-2 days
- **Testing:** 3-5 days

**Total Estimated:** 21-30 days

## 🚀 Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Dark Mode First
Start with dark mode as it's highly requested and affects all components.

### Option 2: Advanced Forms First
If you need complex form functionality immediately, start with DatePicker, MultiSelect, etc.

### Option 3: Performance First
If you're experiencing performance issues, prioritize optimizations.

---

## ✅ What's Already Done

- Basic form components (Input, Checkbox, Radio, Switch)
- Basic charts (BarChart, PieChart, GaugeChart)
- Basic search (FilterChips exists)
- Basic animations (fade, slide)
- Basic loading states
- Component library foundation
