# Analytics

Analytics provide deep visibility into incident patterns, team performance, and operational health. Use these insights to identify trends, optimize response processes, and demonstrate SLA compliance.

## Why Analytics Matter

| Without Analytics          | With Analytics            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Blind to patterns          | Data-driven decisions     |
| Can't prove SLA compliance | Objective SLA tracking    |
| Unknown team workload      | Fair on-call distribution |
| Reactive improvements      | Proactive optimization    |

## Key Metrics

OpsKnight tracks 19+ metrics across incidents, response times, and SLA compliance.

### Response Time Metrics

#### MTTA (Mean Time to Acknowledge)

Average time from incident creation to first acknowledgment.

| Rating        | MTTA         | Interpretation             |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| 🟢 Excellent  | < 5 minutes  | Rapid response             |
| 🟡 Acceptable | 5–15 minutes | Room for improvement       |
| 🔴 Needs Work | > 15 minutes | Review escalation policies |

**Calculation**: Sum of (acknowledgment time - creation time) / acknowledged incidents

#### MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve)

Average time from incident creation to resolution.

| Rating        | MTTR          | Interpretation             |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------------- |
| 🟢 Excellent  | < 30 minutes  | Efficient resolution       |
| 🟡 Acceptable | 30–60 minutes | Typical for complex issues |
| 🔴 Needs Work | > 60 minutes  | Review processes           |

**Calculation**: Sum of (resolution time - creation time) / resolved incidents

#### MTTE (Mean Time to Escalate)

Average time before incidents escalate beyond the first responder.

| Rating     | MTTE         | Interpretation                                 |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🟢 Healthy | > 15 minutes | Primary responders handling most issues        |
| 🟡 Monitor | 5–15 minutes | Moderate escalation rate                       |
| 🔴 Review  | < 5 minutes  | Check if first-level needs more training/tools |

## Best Practices

### Regular Review Cadence

| Cadence       | Focus                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Daily**     | Open incidents, SLA breaches            |
| **Weekly**    | MTTA/MTTR trends, team workload         |
| **Monthly**   | Service health, pattern analysis        |
| **Quarterly** | Capacity planning, process improvements |

### Metric Interpretation

- **Look at trends**, not just snapshots
- **Compare similar periods** (weekday to weekday)
- **Consider context** (holidays, deployments)
- **Investigate anomalies** immediately

### Action Items from Analytics

| Finding                      | Action                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| High MTTA                    | Review escalation policies, notification channels |
| High MTTR                    | Improve runbooks, add automation                  |
| Frequent breaches on service | Review service reliability                        |
| Uneven team workload         | Adjust on-call rotations                          |
| Night/weekend spikes         | Consider follow-the-sun coverage                  |

### Reporting to Stakeholders

- **Lead with business impact** (not raw numbers)
- **Show trends** (improvement or decline)
- **Include action items** (what you're doing about it)
- **Keep it brief** (executive summary first)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Data

1. Check time range filter
2. Verify service/team filters
3. Confirm incidents exist in the period
4. Check user permissions

### Incorrect Metrics

1. Verify incident timestamps are correct
2. Check for manually backdated incidents
3. Review suppressed/snoozed incident handling
4. Confirm timezone settings

### Slow Dashboard

1. Reduce time range
2. Add more specific filters
3. Limit number of widgets
4. Use cached data option
